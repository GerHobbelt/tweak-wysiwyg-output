JavaScript Edit for WYSIWYG Web builder


What is JavaScript Edit?
JavaScript Edit can be used to add/edit and remove the Ready-To-Use JavaScripts for WYSIWYG Web builder.
The Ready-To-Use JavaScripts are stored in a file called 'js.dat' which can be found in the WYSIWYG Web builder folder.
This is a XML file with all script and resources needed to make the script work. Most data in this file is base64-encoded.


How to install JavaScript Edit?
First copy the file 'js.dat' from the C:\Program Folder\WYSIWYG Web Builder 8\ folder to My Documents\WYSIYWG Web Builder\system\
This makes sure you will not overwrite the original file and all your changes will not be overwritten if you install a new version of the software.
WYSIWYG Web Builder automatically load your personal file (instead of the original one) the next time you load the scripts.

Next unzip the JScriptEdit.exe into the same folder as js.dat.


How to use JavaScript Edit?
The usage of JavaScript Edit is pretty straight forward for users that are familiar with JavaScripts.
When you start the application it will display the available javascripts. 
Click Add to add a new script to the script database.
Select one of the scripts and click Edit to change an existing script
Select one of the scripts and click Delete to remove it from the database.

Add/Edit JavaScripts
The edit window includes the following fields:
Name
Name/description of the JavaScript

Code
The JavaScript code, this must include the <SCRIPT> and </SCRIPT> tags.
Variables which can be changed by the end user are marked using %parameter%
For example:
If your JavaScript contains a variable for the speed like
var speed = 10;
you can turn this into a parameter:
var speed = %speed%;
next you need to add a parameter that wil refer to this value.

Header Code
The code you enter here will be inserted inside the <HEAD></HEAD> tags.

Parameters
Parameters which will be available to the end-user. Parameters refer to variables in the script code.
Parameter Name: Name of the parameter that will be displayed in WYSIWYG Web builder.
Parameter Type:
image; displays a file selection dialog
edit;  displays an editbox
color; displays a colorpicker
font;  displays a fontpicker
enum;  displays a dropdown menu with the specified options
url; displays a link picker

Variable
Reference to the variable in the code. For example: %speed%

Value:
Default value for this parameter

Enum
Available options for a dropdown menu seperated by |
For example: 1|2|3|4|5|6|7


Resources
Images or other files which are used by the script.
All files attached to a certain script are automatically placed in the same folder as the HTML file that contains the script.

Copyright
Original author/website of the script.

Compatibility
Specifies the browser compatibility (eg IE6, IE7, Firefox, Opera)

No preview
Enable this option to disable preview in the script selection dialog (in Ready-To-Use-JavaSript). This can be useful if the script only works online or takes a long time to load.

Hide
Enable this option to hide the script in the script selection dialog (in Ready-To-Use-JavaSript). Only used for obsolete scripts.

Put script inside <DIV> tag (used to position the object)
When this option is enabled the script is displayed on the position as specified in the WYSIWYG Web builder workspace (using DIV tags).
When this option is disabled the script is added before the end of the <BODY> tag, without positioning info.


Final Notes:
- This utility is for advanced users only, use it at your own risk.
- Check out the available examples, to get an idea how everything works.
- If you have created a wondeful script and want to share it with all other Web builder users, please send me a copy of your js.dat file so maybe I can include it in one of the next Web Builder updates.
